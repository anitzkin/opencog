/// The BetaRedex link is used to specify a set of values that are to
/// be attached to the variables of a function named by a DefineLink.
/// Thus, a BetaRedex vaguely resembles a "function call", except that
/// no actual call is made (nor is any grounding or evaluation made).
/// The BetaRedex merely serves to specify the values that will be
/// passed to the named function. The name `BetaRedex` comes from the
/// concept of beta reduction in lambda calculus. The actual
/// substitution (beta-reduction) does not take place until the
/// `substitute` method is called.  Note, however, that the substitute
/// method only substitutes; it does not perform any evaluation,
/// grounding or calling. Thus, it is just a beta reduction, and nothing
/// more.
///
/// The intended use of this link type is to specify (name) patterns
/// that will be expanded during the course of a  pattern match.  The 
///
/// The BetaRedex link must have the following form:
///
///      BetaRedex
///          SomeNamingAtom
///          SomeOrderedLink
///             Argument_1
///             Argument_2
///             ...
///             Argument_N
///
/// The "SomeNamingAtom" will typically be a Node, a ConceptNode or a
/// PredicteNode, but it doesn't have to be.  However, it MUST appear
/// as the name of a DefineLink; that is, there MUST be a corresponding
/// DefineLink of the form
///
///      DefineLink
///          SomeNamingAtom
///          ScopeLink   ;;; Or SatisfactionLink or BindLink....
///              Vardecls
///              BodyAtom
///
/// The "SomeNamingAtom" must be exactly the same in the Define and the
/// BetaRedex; this is how the BetaRedex is able to find the defined
/// body.  The DefineLink does not have to be created before the
/// BetaRedex is created; however, it must exist by the time the
/// composition is used.  The DefineLink has to name either a
/// ScopeLink, or one of the link types inheriting from it (e.g. a
/// BindLink or SatisfactionLink).
///
/// The "SomeOrderedLink" holds the set of arguments associated with the
/// name.  These arguments may be "values", or they may be VariableNodes,
/// or a mixture of the two.  A "value" is anything that is not a
/// VariableNode.  If the arguments are values, then they MUST obey
/// the type restrictions specified in the ScopeLink.  If they are
/// VariableNodes, then they inherit the type restrictions from the
/// ScopeLink.
