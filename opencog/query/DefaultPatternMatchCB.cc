// "item" will be much smaller, and so makes a better choice.  The code
// below tries to pass over "blah" and pick "item" instead.  It does so
// by comparing the size of the incoming sets of the two constants, and
// picking the one with the smaller ("thinner") incoming set. Note that
// this is a form of "greedy" search.
//
// Atoms that are inside of dynamically-evaluatable terms are not
// considered. That's because groundings for such terms might not exist
// in the atomspace, so a search that starts there is doomed to fail.
//
// Note that the algo explores the clause to its greatest depth. That's
// OK, because typical clauses are never very deep.
//

// into the "thinnest" calculation, so that only high-AF atoms are

/**
 * Search for solutions/groundings over all of the AtomSpace, using
 * the standard, canonical assumptions about the structure of the search
 * pattern.  Here, the "standard, canonical" assumptions are that the
 * pattern consists of clauses that contain VariableNodes in them, with
 * the VariableNodes interpreted in the "standard, canonical" way:
 * namely, that these are the atoms that are to be grounded, as normally
 * described elsewhere in the documentation.  In such a case, a full and
 * complete search for any/all possible groundings is performed; if
 * there are groundings, they are guaranteed to be found; if there are
 * none, then it is guaranteed that this will also be correctly
 * reported. For certain, highly unusual (but still canonical) search
 * patterns, the same grounding may be reported more than once; grep for
 * notes pertaining to the ChoiceLink, and the ArcanaUTest for details.
 * Otherwise, all possible groundings are guaranteed to be returned
 * exactly once.
 *
 * We emphasize "standard, canonical" here, for a reason: the pattern
 * engine is capable of doing many strange, weird things, depending on
 * how the callbacks are designed to work.  For those other
 * applications, it is possible or likely that this method will fail to
 * traverse the "interesting" parts of the atomspace: non-standard
 * callbacks may also need a non-standard search strategy.
 *
 * Now, some notes on the strategy employed here, and how non-canonical
 * callbacks might affect it:
 *
 * 1) Search will begin at the first non-variable node in the "thinnest"
 *    clause.  The thinnest clause is chosen, so as to improve performance;
 *    but this has no effect on the thoroughness of the search.  The search
 *    will proceed by exploring the entire incoming-set for this node.
 *
 *    This is ideal, when the node_match() callback accepts a match only
 *    when the pattern and suggested nodes are identical (i.e. are
 *    exactly the same atom).  If the node_match() callback is willing to
 *    accept a broader range of node matches, then other possible
 *    solutions might be missed. Just how to fix this depends sharpely
 *    on what node_match() is willing to accept as a match.
 *
 *    Anyway, this seems like a very reasonable limitation: if you
 *    really want a lenient node_match(), then use variables instead.
 *    Don't overload node-match with something weird, and you should be
 *    OK.  Otherwise, you'll have to implement your own initiate_search()
 *    callback.
 *
 * 2) If the clauses consist entirely of variables, i.e. if there is not
 *    even one single non-variable node in the pattern, then a search is
 *    driven by looking for all links that are of the same type as one
 *    of the links in one of the clauses.
 *
 *    If the link_match() callback is willing to accept a broader range
 *    of types, then this search method may fail to find some possible
 *    patterns.
 *
 *    Lets start by noting that this situation is very rare: most
 *    patterns will not consist entirely if Links and VariableNodes.
 *    Almost surely, most reasonable people will have at least one
 *    non-variable node in the pattern. So the disucssion below almost
 *    surely does not apply.
 *
 *    But if yhou really want this, there are several possible remedies.
 *    One is to modify the link_type_search() callback to try each
 *    possible link type that is considered bo be equivalent by
 *    link_match(). Another alternative is to just leave the
 *    link_match() callback alone, and use variables for links, instead.
 *    This is probably the best strategy, because then the fairly
 *    standard reasoning can be used when thinking about the problem.
 *    Of course, you can always write your own initiate_search() callback.
 *
 * If the constraint 1) can be met, (which is always the case for
 * "standard, canonical" searches, then the pattern match should be
 * quite rapid.  Incoming sets tend to be small; in addition, the
 * implemnentation here picks the smallest, "tinnest" incoming set to
 * explore.
 *
 * The default implementation of node_match() and link_match() in this
 * class does satisfy both 1) and 2), so this algo will work correctly,
 * if these two methods are not overloaded with more callbacks that are
 * lenient about matching.
 *
 * If you overload node_match(), and do so in a way that breaks
 * assumption 1), then you will scratch your head, thinking
 * "why did my search fail to find this obvious solution?" The answer
 * will be for you to create a new search algo, in a new class, that
 * overloads this one, and does what you want it to.  This class should
 * probably *not* be modified, since it is quite efficient for the
 * "standard, canonical" case.

 * This callback implements the handling of the special case where the
 * pattern consists of a single clause, at the top of which there is an
 * ChoiceLink. In this situation, one effectively has multiple, unrelated
 * grounding problems at hand, and they need to be treated as such.
 *
 * The core issue here is that, from the point of view of satisfiability,
 * each subgraph that occurs inside an ChoiceLink might be grounded by a
 * graph that is disconnected from the other subgraphs. There is no
 * a-priori way of knowing whether the groundings might be connected,
 * and thus, the worst-case must be assumed: each subgraph that occurs
 * inside an ChoiceLink must be considered to be a unique, independent
 * graph, which must be assumed to be disconnected from each of the
 * other subgraphs (even though they "accidentally" share a common
 * variable name).
 *
 * This is best understood through an example. Consider the clause
 *
 *   ChoiceLink
 *       ListLink
 *           ConceptNode Hunt
 *           VariableNode $X
 *       ListLink
 *           VariableNode $X
 *           ConceptNode Zebra
 *
 * Suppose that the Universe over which this is being grounded consists
 * of only two clauses:
 *
 *   ListLink
 *       ConceptNode Hunt
 *       ConceptNode RedOctober
 *
 *   ListLink
 *       ConceptNode IceStation
 *       ConceptNode Zebra
 *
 * Suppose that the search for a grounding is begun at `Hunt`. Then, the
 * `RedOctober` is found, so $X is grounded by `RedOctober`.  From here,
 * it is impossible to walk the graph in a connected manner to find the
 * alternative grounding: `IceStation`.  To find `IceStation`, a second
 * search needs to be launched, starting at `Zebra`.
 *
 * Since the pattern matcher is only able to walk over connected
 * graphs, it must be assumed a-priori that each subgraph in an ChoiceLink
 * is disconnected from the others. The only way that these two sub
 * graphs might prove to be connected is if the variable $X is used in
 * some other clause, thus establishing connectivity from that clause to
 * the subgraphs of the ChoiceLink.
 *
 * The practical side-effect, here, with regards to satsifcation, is
 * this: if both groundings are to be found in the above example, then
 * two efforts must be made: One effort, with the initial grounding
 * starting at `Hunt`, and a second, starting at `Zebra`.  So... that
 * is what we do here, with the ChoiceLink loop.
